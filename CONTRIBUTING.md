## How to contribute

### Git-Related

#### **Did you find a bug?** / **Do you want to suggest something?**

* Create an issue at [this issue page](https://github.com/MisterPeModder/Bomberman-Global-Offensive/issues).

#### **Do you want to create a branch?**

* Your branch name should be formatted as `fix/<ISSUENUMBER>-<TITLE>` for bug fixes or `feature/<ISSUENUMBER>-<TITLE>` for features, example: `fix/4221-infinite-loop`.

#### **Do you want to fix an issue?**

* Create a branch

* Implement your features of fixes in it.

* Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/MisterPeModder/Bomberman-Global-Offensive/pulls).

* Once validated, merge to PR to `master` and remove the source branch (with `git branch -D <branch_name>`.

#### **How to title commits?**

* Follow the guidelines at https://cbea.ms/git-commit/

* Use imperative tense (avoid past tense).

* The title of the commit must be a summuary of the content and not be too long (less than 50 characters).

* Prefer putting detailed informations inside the commit's description.

* Example:
  ```sh
  $> git commit -m 'Fix infinite loop when pressing Alt-F4
  
  This was caused by a missing check in the event loop
  The program now checks when the window is set to close'
  ```

### Code Documentation

[Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) is the tool of choice for code documentation the format to use for in-code documentation is as follows:

* Doc comments are signaled by triple-slashes (`///`) for each line.

* Doxygen commands are written javadoc-style, using `@` instead of `\` (e.g. `@param`).

* Documented items should have a sentence (may span more than a line) that quickly describes it.
  It is called a `brief` in Doxygen terms, but the `@brief` command that would be present here shall be omitted.

* The brief line should be separated from the rest of the doc comment by an empty comment.

* Example:
  ```cpp
  /// Short brief line.
  ///
  /// More in-depth description (optional)
  ///
  /// @param parameter1 Parameter description.
  /// 
  /// @returns Some value
  /// @throws std::logic_error Error condition.
  int someFunction(int parameter1);
  ```
  
***

### Coding Style

* The format to use is defined in the [.clang_format](https://github.com/MisterPeModder/Bomberman-Global-Offensive/blob/master/.clang-format) file at the root of the project.

* Use lowerCamelCase for function names and non-constant variables.

* Use SCREAMING_CASE for constants:
  ```cpp
  constexpr int MEANING_OF_LIFE = 42;
  ```
* Use UpperCamelCase for type names (classes, structs, enums, type aliases and template parameters):
  ```cpp
  template <typename ValueType>
  struct SuperSecretData {
      using ValuePtr = *ValueType;
      ValueType data;
  };
  ```

### **DOs and DONTs**

* :x: **DONT**: Push to the `master` (or `main`) branch for any reason, please submit a PR instead.

* :x: **DONT**: Create a branch with your username as the title

* :heavy_check_mark: **DO**: Commit often! allows everyone to see your progress and eventually make suggestions on it.

* :heavy_check_mark: **DO**: Format your code, using either `clang-format` directly or your IDE's capabilities (and yes, VSCode can format your code for you!)
